## 2024-05-26 - Authorization Bypass in Voice Commands
**Vulnerability:** Missing Authorization (IDOR/Griefing)
**Learning:** Destructive commands (`stop`, `skip`, `leave`, `clear`) did not verify if the user was in the same voice channel as the bot. This allowed any user (even those not listening) to disrupt playback for everyone else.
**Prevention:** Implemented an `is_privileged` check to ensure the command invoker shares the same voice channel as the bot before allowing playback modifications.
